# 🌐 GRE Tunnel VPN Lab – Toronto ↔ Montréal

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a **GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation) tunnel** between two remote sites (Toronto and Montréal) using Cisco Packet Tracer.

The goal is to simulate a real-world WAN environment where two private LAN networks communicate securely over an ISP network.

---

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated
- Network configuration (Cisco routers & switches)
- WAN and ISP simulation
- GRE Tunnel configuration
- Dynamic routing using EIGRP
- VLAN segmentation (Router-on-a-stick)
- Troubleshooting and network testing

---

## 🔑 Key Skills for IT Support
- Troubleshooting network connectivity issues
- Configuring VPN tunnels (GRE)
- Understanding TCP/IP and routing
- VLAN segmentation and switch configuration
- Diagnosing connectivity with ping and routing tables
---

## 🏗️ Network Architecture
- Two sites: Toronto (R1) and Montréal (R2)
- ISP network acting as intermediary
- GRE Tunnel over public IP addresses
- VLAN 10 & VLAN 20 for network segmentation

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used
