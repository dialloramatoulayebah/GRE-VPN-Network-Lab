# Network Topology Diagram

This file should contain the network topology diagram showing:
- R1 Router (Toronto)
- R2 Router (Montreal)
- ISP Router
- GRE Tunnel connection between R1 and R2
- LAN networks (192.168.10.0/24 for Toronto, 192.168.20.0/24 for Montreal)
- WAN connections through ISP

To add the actual diagram:
1. Create a network topology diagram using a tool like draw.io, Visio, or Packet Tracer
2. Export as PNG format
3. Replace this file with the actual network_topology.png image

Expected diagram elements:
- Router icons for R1, R2, and ISP
- Cloud/tunnel icon for GRE tunnel
- PC/Switch icons for LAN networks
- Labels for all interfaces and IP addresses
- Legend showing the connection types
