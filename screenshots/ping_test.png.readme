# Ping Test Screenshot

This file should contain a screenshot demonstrating successful ping tests between:
- Toronto LAN to Montreal LAN (across the GRE tunnel)
- Example: ping from 192.168.10.10 to 192.168.20.10

To add the actual screenshot:
1. Open Packet Tracer and load the Pratique_GRE.pkt file
2. Perform ping tests from a PC in Toronto network to a PC in Montreal network
3. Capture a screenshot showing successful ping results
4. Save as PNG format
5. Replace this file with the actual ping_test.png image

Expected screenshot should show:
- Command prompt or terminal window
- Ping command with destination IP
- Successful ping replies with response times
- Statistics showing 0% packet loss
