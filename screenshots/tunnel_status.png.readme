# Tunnel Status Screenshot

This file should contain a screenshot showing the GRE tunnel status and configuration.

To add the actual screenshot:
1. Open Packet Tracer and load the Pratique_GRE.pkt file
2. Access R1 or R2 router CLI
3. Run commands to verify tunnel status:
   - show interface tunnel 0
   - show ip interface brief
   - show ip route (to verify routes through tunnel)
4. Capture a screenshot showing tunnel is up and routing is working
5. Save as PNG format
6. Replace this file with the actual tunnel_status.png image

Expected screenshot should show:
- Tunnel interface status (up/up)
- Tunnel source and destination
- Tunnel IP address configuration
- Line protocol status
- Routing table entries using the tunnel interface
